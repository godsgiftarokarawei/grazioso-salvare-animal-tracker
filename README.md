Grazioso Salvare Animal Tracking System

The Grazioso Salvare Animal Tracking System is a Java-based application designed to manage and track search-and-rescue animals. The program leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, such as inheritance and encapsulation, to efficiently handle different types of animals, including dogs and monkeys.

This system allows users to
Add new animals (dogs or monkeys) to the system.
Reserve animals for service.
View lists of animals based on specific criteria.

 Files Included
 `Dog.java`          Class for managing dog-specific attributes.     
 `Monkey.java`       Class for managing monkey-specific attributes.  
 `RescueAnimal.java` Parent class containing shared attributes.      
 `Driver.java`       Main program to interact with the system.       

 Key Features
1. Input Validation Ensures proper data entry for animals and reservations.
2. Menu-based Interface A user-friendly menu for program interaction.
3. OOP Principles
   Inheritance for code reuse (e.g., `RescueAnimal` as a parent class).
   Encapsulation with getters and setters for data access.
4. Data Management Users can
   Add animals.
   Reserve animals for search and rescue.
   Print animal details based on availability and type.

Example Menu (Output)
The main menu provides the following options
Intake a new dog
Intake a new monkey
Reserve an animal
Print animals
Exit

Users can follow prompts to interact with the system effectively.

Future Enhancements
Add persistence (e.g., saving data to a file or database).
Extend to include other animal types.
Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
